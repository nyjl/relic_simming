# 847 "One against many" or 758.6 "Unending rage"?

Remember, there are no stupid questions!
Except for this one though, because the answer is always "sim it yourself".

# Step 1. Get SimCraft

Latest stable version is here. You can be sure it works fine
http://simulationcraft.org/download.html
if there were some hotfixes on live WoW, or new patch you may need to use latest build from here
http://downloads.simulationcraft.org/
you go to the end of the list

and pick the one with the latest date. Download, unzip.

# Step 2. Launch SimCraft

Go to unzipped folder, launch SimulationCraft64.exe (or 32 if you are using 32bit version)

# Step 3. Import your character

There are two ways to do it. You can install this addon

go ingame, write "/simc", copy your profile from the window, go to "Simulate" tab

and paste your profile here. All set!

Your profile ends up in the same place, at "Simulate" tab

# Step 4. Edit your profile to change a relic

Scroll to the end of your profile and find a line starting with "main_hand=", copy it

Add new line at the end of your profile
copy="me with a new relic"
